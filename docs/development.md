# Development

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 8.0.x (verify with `dotnet --version`)
- A GitHub PAT with `read:packages` scope, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
  for pulling `KyuzanInc.Turnkey.Sdk` from GitHub Packages (see below)
- Optional for Unity smoke: Unity 2021.2 LTS or newer, plus
  NuGetForUnity 4.x for consuming locally-packed `.nupkg`s

## GitHub Packages auth setup (one-time)

`KyuzanInc.Turnkey.Sdk` is published to GitHub Packages until it ships
to nuget.org. Restoring this repo therefore needs a personal access
token (classic, scope `read:packages`) — fine-grained tokens with
package read access also work.

The repo's `nuget.config` already declares the `github-kyuzan` source,
but it stores no credentials (and must not). Attach credentials to the
user-level config instead — that file is independent of the repo's
config, so `add source` does not collide with the repo's declaration
when scoped via `--configfile`. Use `add source` the first time on a
machine; `update source` on later token refreshes:

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...   # PAT with read:packages

# Make sure the user-level NuGet config exists as valid XML
# (brand-new profiles do not have it yet, and `add source` rejects
# an empty file with "Root element is missing").
mkdir -p ~/.nuget/NuGet
[ -s ~/.nuget/NuGet/NuGet.Config ] || cat > ~/.nuget/NuGet/NuGet.Config <<'XML'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
</configuration>
XML

# First time on this machine — declare the source in the user config:
dotnet nuget add source https://nuget.pkg.github.com/KyuzanInc/index.json \
  --name github-kyuzan \
  --username <your-github-username> \
  --password "$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  --store-password-in-clear-text \
  --configfile ~/.nuget/NuGet/NuGet.Config

# Subsequent token refreshes use update-source (NOT add-source —
# that would error with duplicate-source on second run):
# dotnet nuget update source github-kyuzan \
#   --username <your-github-username> \
#   --password "$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
#   --store-password-in-clear-text \
#   --configfile ~/.nuget/NuGet/NuGet.Config
```

Alternatively, edit `~/.nuget/NuGet/NuGet.Config` directly. Adding only
a `packageSourceCredentials` block (without re-declaring the source)
attaches credentials to the repo-declared source without duplication:

```xml
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="github-kyuzan" value="https://nuget.pkg.github.com/KyuzanInc/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
  <packageSourceCredentials>
    <github-kyuzan>
      <add key="Username" value="<your-github-username>" />
      <add key="ClearTextPassword" value="ghp_..." />
    </github-kyuzan>
  </packageSourceCredentials>
</configuration>
```

If `dotnet restore` fails with `401 Unauthorized` against
`nuget.pkg.github.com`, the token is missing the `read:packages` scope
or has not been granted access to the `KyuzanInc/turnkey-sdk-csharp`
package.

## Build

```
dotnet restore peak-sdk-csharp.sln --locked-mode
dotnet build peak-sdk-csharp.sln -c Release
```

`--locked-mode` is mandatory for reproducibility. The committed
`packages.lock.json` files under
`packages/peak-sdk-csharp/{src,tests}/` are the source of truth for
the resolved dependency graph; CI uses the same flag.

The build is deterministic (`Deterministic=true` in
`Directory.Build.props`) and `ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true` is
toggled on by the `CI` env var, so CI artifacts are reproducible.

## Test

```
dotnet test peak-sdk-csharp.sln -c Release --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

E2E tests are gated by environment variables:

```
export TURNKEY_TEST_ORG_API_KEY=...
export TURNKEY_TEST_ORG_ID=...
dotnet test peak-sdk-csharp.sln --filter "Category=E2E"
```

Without those variables, the E2E suite is silently skipped — not
failed.

## Consuming `KyuzanInc.Peak.Sdk` from another project

`KyuzanInc.Peak.Sdk` publishes to GitHub Packages on every `v*` tag
(it is the only published package — `KyuzanInc.Peak.PublicApiClient`
is `internal` / `IsPackable=false`, and the Unity adapter is not in the
solution). A downstream project that has the `github-kyuzan` source
configured — the same one-time auth setup as above, which also serves
the transitive `KyuzanInc.Turnkey.Sdk` — installs the published package
straight from the feed (`--prerelease` is required while the latest
published version is the `0.1.0-alpha.1` prerelease — a bare
`dotnet add package` resolves stable versions only):

```
dotnet add package KyuzanInc.Peak.Sdk --prerelease
```

The repo's own `nuget.config` maps `KyuzanInc.Peak.*` to `local-feed`
(see below) for the local-pack workflow; a downstream consumer does not
copy that mapping, so its `KyuzanInc.Peak.Sdk` resolves from
`github-kyuzan` instead.

### Local `.nupkg` feed (offline or unreleased versions)

To consume a build that is not on GitHub Packages — offline, or a
version between releases — pack to a local feed:

```
dotnet pack peak-sdk-csharp.sln -c Release -o ./local-feed
```

Point a downstream `nuget.config` at the absolute `./local-feed` path
and `dotnet add package KyuzanInc.Peak.Sdk --prerelease` from there. The
downstream project still needs the GitHub Packages source configured,
because
`KyuzanInc.Peak.Sdk` pulls `KyuzanInc.Turnkey.Sdk` transitively. Unity
consumers via NuGetForUnity follow the same pattern after the
`.nupkg` is copied into the Unity project's Packages folder.

## Bumping `KyuzanInc.Turnkey.Sdk`

See [docs/sync-rules.md](sync-rules.md) for the full bump procedure.
TL;DR:

1. Edit `Directory.Packages.props` to set the new version.
2. `dotnet restore peak-sdk-csharp.sln --force-evaluate`
3. Commit the refreshed `packages.lock.json` files.
4. Run the wire-format smoke locally:
   `dotnet test peak-sdk-csharp.sln --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TurnkeyWireFormatSmokeTests"`
5. Open a PR with the upstream release notes linked in the body.

## Lint / format

```
dotnet format peak-sdk-csharp.sln --verify-no-changes
```

The `.editorconfig` is normative. Roslyn analyzer severities flag
weak / broken cryptographic algorithm usage as errors.

## Re-sync upstream snapshots

```
./scripts/sync-upstream.sh peak-sdk-unity <new-commit-sha>
./scripts/sync-upstream.sh peak-server-openapi <new-tag>
```

Each command produces one commit on a `sync/` branch. Review and
merge per [docs/sync-rules.md](sync-rules.md).

## Cross-platform notes

- Windows `net8.0-windows`: DPAPI is the only built-in `ISecureStorage`.
  Storage still defaults to `InMemoryStorage`; other TFMs expose no built-in
  available `ISecureStorage`.
- macOS / Linux: build and test green on .NET 8; no built-in
  secure storage in v0.1.0.
- Unity mobile: the separate
  [`com.kyuzan.peak-sdk-unity`](https://github.com/KyuzanInc/peak-sdk-unity)
  UPM package v0.8.0 offers opt-in `EncryptedPlayerPrefsStorage` with iOS
  Keychain / Android Keystore DEK protection. It implements `IStorage`, not a
  C# `ISecureStorage`; this repo does not ship `KeychainSecureStorage` or
  `KeyStoreSecureStorage`. The storage path requests no biometrics or passcode.
- Unity Editor / standalone: that UPM package retains its software-derived
  interim provider for development; do not treat it as an OS-protected
  production backend.
